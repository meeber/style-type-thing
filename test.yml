  # This rule is modified from the base config to allow lines that begin with

  # change is to improve the quality of life while writing tests with Mocha.
  # It's common to write a description for an `it` or `describe` statement that
  # causes the line to exceed 80 characters, and it's inconvenient and inelegant
  # to split the description across multiple lines, especially given that the
  # second parameter is a function.
